Creating the game Tic Tac Toe
There are 9 div's each is a square when clicked on they display an x or o acordingly
To test for winners I used the magic square method
I originallly started with a brute force method but then moved onto magic squares once that was a success
I used some bootstrap grid to make resizing the screen a little better
But still more to make look good in the mobile platform
Scores are displayed

deployed on firebase
