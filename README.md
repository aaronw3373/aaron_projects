Tic Tac Toe

tick-tack-toe.firebaseapp.com

I first created a working app for a local player The first time through I used brute forcce winning conditions but then I used magic square winning conditions

I added scores,a new game, and reset scores elements.

Then I added a chat.

Then I saved that code in a separate branch and began working on a networked game using firebase. After many trials and tribulations It came alive.

Then I added back in the option to play locally or someone from a different location.

The next step will be to allow multiple networked games to happen currentlly only one is possible.
