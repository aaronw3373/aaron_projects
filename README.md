Tic Tac Toe

tick-tack-toe.firebaseapp.com

I first created a working app for a local player The first time through I used brute forcce winning conditions but then I used magic square winning conditions

I added scores,a new game, and reset scores elements.

I added a chat.

I saved that code in a separate branch and began working on a networked game using firebase. After many trials and tribulations It came alive.

I added back in the option to play locally or someone from a different location.

I then used the magic square win function to play against the computer
The computer checks using magic squares if there is a move it can make to win, if not a move to make to block the player from winning and if not it goes in the middle and if none of those then iit goes randomly

The next step will be to allow multiple networked games to happen currentlly only one is possible.
