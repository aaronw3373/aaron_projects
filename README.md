Creating the game Tic Tac Toe
There are 9 div's each is a square when clicked on the display an x or o
to test for winners I used the magic square method
I originallly started with a brute force method but then moved onto magic squares
I am adding a scores counter and a better reset button I will then start to improve my css and look into bootstrap's posibilities for making this a mobile first game.
If that is all done then I will begin making it a multi device game meaning playing another either friend or anonymous player on a separate device.
